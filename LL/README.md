# LL parser
Here, you will find a "LL" parser.

Currently, I wrote the code in rust, C and python will come soon

## Quickstart

# Usage (rust)
### Quickstart

To install, see installation instructions.\
Then, try this code :
```rust
use llk::*;

fn main(){
	j
}

```

### Install
To install it as a dependency, just add this line to your Cargo.toml :
```toml
[dependencies]
llk = "0.1.0"
```
If you want to install it locally, do :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dalejosne/Automata
```
And every files you need will be on the subdirectory Automata/game_of_life.

### Doc
After having installed it, do :
```
cargo doc
```
And then open the file index.html on the directory target/doc/game_of_life
